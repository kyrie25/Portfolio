# [rrat](https://legacy.kyrie25.dev)

Pretty fun project tbh, my small experiment to make functional code **Note**: Technically can use APNG as background, but I don't want to bombard loading time with a 20mb (or more) file

Run `yarn` to deploy all dependencies if you intend to clone this

```typescript
function about() {
	terminal.innerHTML +=
		'\n<img alt="icon" class="img" src="static/about.png">\n' +
		"  <div><span>kyrie25</span>@<span>github.io</span></div>\n" +
		"  <div>---------------------</div>\n" +
		"  <div><span>About this page</span></div>\n" +
		"  <div>This is my <span>first</span> website</div>\n" +
		"  <div>Basically a portfolio/'About Me'</div>\n" +
		"  <div>It probably won't be updated by the time you're reading this</div>\n" +
		"  <div>Credit to stuff I've used in this page:</div>\n" +
		"  <div><span>About 70% of the website</span>: Me</div>\n" +
		"  <div><span>Core script/functionality</span>: Generous stranger on GitHub, not sure who they were</div>\n" +
		"  <div><span>Nazrin</span>: rrat</div>\n" +
		"  <div><span>Home page artwork</span>: <a href=\"https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/58056024\" target='_blank'>にしもん</a></div>\n" +
		"  <div><span>Music page artwork</span>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramdayo1122/status/1480119998391918594\" target='_blank'>LAM</a></div>\n" +
		"  <div><span>About page artwork</span>: <a href=\"https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/47516247\" target='_blank'>にしもん</a></div>\n" +
		"  <div>Please support the respective owners of the works, they really are awesome <3</div>\n" +
		'  <div style="padding-bottom:10px; clear: both;">';
}
```
